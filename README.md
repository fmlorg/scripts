## CVS to GIT conversion

cvs2git-simple a simple Bourne shell script to convert CVS to GIT.
This may be a minimum script which just wraps "git cvsimport".
I hope this is suitable to learn a shell script writing.
So I would like to keep this script within 100+ lines if could.
Please hack it as you wish. It is the best programming exercise.
